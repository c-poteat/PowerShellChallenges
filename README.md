# PowerShell Challenges

Various challenges performed while using the PowerShell language. Folders will be separated in different categories.

## Description

The overall goal is to solve challenges while using PowerShell. Will convert challenges from other programming languages and apply using PowerShell.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
